### `Technologies used `
styled components - same with emotionjs(css in js)
context api instead of redux - The project is not that large to use a heavy lib like redux, the context architecture is redux like still.
### `isues encountered`

the sortby functionality is not working because i belive that the api should provide a query string where the sort queries will be passed in other to sortby
